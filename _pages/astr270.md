## About Me

üëã Hi there! I'm Andy Tzanidakis, your TA for ASTR 270. I'm a forth-year astronomy Ph.D. student studying Galactic stellar variables. I‚Äôm the current director and program coordinator for the University of Washington‚Äôs planetarium. I‚Äôm really looking forward to meeting and working with you all!

I'm deeply passionate about science communication and STEM education. I firmly believe that effective communication is one of the most vital skillsets in the professional world. In an era where science and technology are at the forefront of modern living, academics, scientists, and educators must pay special attention to how we communicate science to the public. As researchers and professionals, we have a civil duty to engage in public outreach and make scientific knowledge accessible. Now more than ever, bridging the gap between complex scientific concepts and public understanding is crucial. Throughout my career, I have been fortunate to participate in various science communication opportunities, and I am eager to share the experiences and insights I've gained along the way.
