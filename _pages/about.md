Hello, I'm Anastasios (Andy) Tzanidakis ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm a third-year astronomy Ph.D. student at the University of Washington and the director for the UW Planetarium. 
My academic interests include data analysis of large-scale astronomical survyes, time-domain astronomy, transients, and stellar variability.
