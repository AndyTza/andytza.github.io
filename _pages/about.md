Hello, I'm Anastasios (Andy) Tzanidakis ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm a fourth-year astronomy Ph.D. candidate at the University of Washington and the director for the [University of Washington Planetarium](https://astro.washington.edu/uw-planetarium). 
My academic interests include data analysis of large-scale astronomical surveys, stellar variability, time-domain astronomy, and the classification of transient phenomena.

Please contact me by email: [atzanida@uw.edu](mailto:atzanida@uw.edu).
