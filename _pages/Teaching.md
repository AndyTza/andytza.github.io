## About me  
___

Hey class!

My name is Anastasios, but you can call me Andy. I am a first-year Ph.D. astronomy student in the Department of Astronomy at the University of Washington. Currently, I work with the Vera Rubin Observatory data commissioning team on the characterization of light curve moments for stellar transients that we will discover with the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). I'm also very interested in stars as a probe to understand the formation history of the Milky Way! ðŸ”­

Outside of academia, I love climbing, surfing, cooking, taking photos, drinking cold brew and eating scones (yum!), and listening to my favorite band, Fleet Foxes!

I look forward to meeting you all in the coming weeks ðŸ˜„

If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, please reach out via email [atzanida@uw.edu](atzanida@uw.edu).

## My Role
---

### General Objectives
I am very excited to be your TA for ASTR 150 this coming quarter. My **objective** is to help you **all** succeed in the course and support you with the course material. All to say, whatever your needs are, always make sure to communicate that with Professor Kelly, me or any of the other TA's, and I will do my best to accommodate your needs.

### Zoom Office Hours
I plan on having office hours twice a week. Starting in March 28, the office hours will be on zoom. It will *possibly* be subject to change depending on if the COVID rates improve. Here are the logistics:

- Office Hours: Monday/Wednesday: 10 AM to 11 AM
- Zoom Office Hours Link: [here](https://washington.zoom.us/my/astroandy) or full URL: https://washington.zoom.us/my/astroandy

---
**NOTE**
If the listed office hours do not work with your schedule, please email me, and we
can coordinate a separate time to meet and talk about your questions.
---

### Grading
It is also worth mentioning that I will be responsible for grading your assignments. Unfortunately, I will **not** be able to confirm if your homework answers are correct before the deadline. Instead, I usually reply with a series of questions that can hopefully guide you in the right direction. When in doubt, just make sure to reach out, and I will do my best to clarify any issues.

## TA Resources & Information
----
Every week I will be updating this Notion [page](https://astro-andy-uw.notion.site/ASTR-150E-TA-Andy-Tzanidakis-Resources-919eb4f7cbfd4ba8ba4198ab52dd4696) where you can find handy blog posts I've put together for the week.  

I look forwards to getting to know you all this coming quarter!
